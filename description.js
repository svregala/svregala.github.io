      + "The application is deployed and managed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). "
      + "The backend application is written in Node.js on the server side with the Express framework. "
      + "The application consists of features such as navigation bar, autocomplete, routing, search form, results table, business details card, and reservation form. "
      + "Regarding the iOS application, I utilized Swift and SwiftUI framework on XCode to build a native iOS application that allows users to perform a business search; "
      + "with the help of the Yelp API, it provides users coherent results and informative details about the specified businesses. "
      + "Morever, I practiced the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern and applied third-party libraries through Swift Package Manager such as Alamofire, Kingfisher, and SwiftyJSON.",
