      + "The application is deployed and managed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). "
      + "The backend application is written in Node.js on the server side with the Express framework. "
      + "The application consists of features such as navigation bar, autocomplete, routing, search form, results table, business details card, and reservation form. "
      + "Regarding the iOS application, I utilized Swift and SwiftUI framework on XCode to build a native iOS application that allows users to perform a business search; "
      + "with the help of the Yelp API, it provides users coherent results and informative details about the specified businesses. "
      + "Morever, I practiced the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern and applied third-party libraries through Swift Package Manager such as Alamofire, Kingfisher, and SwiftyJSON.",

      + "First, I applied the Genetic Algorithm to a 3D Travelling-Salesman Problem using Java to find the optimal path given a list of 3D coordinates. "
      + "Second, I developed an AI agent based on the minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning using Python to play Go-5x5 (Little-Go); I successfully outperformed the random, greedy, aggressive, alpha-beta, and Q-learner agents constructed by the course producers. "
      + "Lastly, I implemented a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch (without the use of machine learning libraries and external libraries other than NumPy) using Python, and used it to classify from four different datasets: Spiral, Circle, XOR, Gaussian. I was able to achieve 94%+ accuracy on each of the sample datasets provided in course grading.",

"
      + "To implement communication channels, I utilized TCP and UDP messaging protocols. "
